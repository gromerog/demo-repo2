Well the use of <article> inside section is the right use… even in the link provided by Dave the example shows it that way… and than, what is ment to be and isn’t…
If you so please you can have <section> with <article> that contain their own sub <section> and the web site will still work propperly… just means that you structure your code differently…

To append to ulli’s comment: A “section” of content containing articles, and a “section” of content within an article containing either the body of the article, or anything else appended to it. In the case of the mozilla example, the section within the article contains reviews of the article, or reviews of the particular subject in question.

That’s a nice syntax for documents. For webpages you ought to place the navigation after the content for accessibility purposes.

consider instead:

<header>
...
</header>
<section>
...
</section>
<nav>
...
</nav>
<footer>
...
</footer>

You can still make the nav appear in the header of the page (or wherever else you want) using CSS, but when a blind user reads the page with a screen reader, they won’t be affronted with the long list of links until after they’re finished reading the content of the page.

Additionally, when drop-down menus are used they will appear over embedded content (rather than hiding under) due to their lower location in the DOM.

Not Quite! You can put it at the top of the page. Check out the The MDN Specs.

User agents, such as screen readers targeting disabled users, can use this element to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of this content.

Download the html5shiv.js and include the below mentioned code into the head tag

     <!--[if lt IE 9]>-->


It renders HTML5 element dynamically in the DOM and rules out the cross-browsr compatibility issues in IE6-8.

IE8 will not recognize these styles when using this markup.

For example:
tag in the stylesheet
header {width:940px; margin:auto; padding:0;}

doc:
Hello World

When you render the page in IE8 the content will not be centered. If rendered in FF or Safari everything works fine.

Finally HTML5 brings a better form of semantic markup! The element makes more sense for navigation than the old

<

ul> (unordered list) or

<

ol> (ordered list) elements, since those lists could represent anything. With the tag search engines can better define the idea that this tag is intended for navigational use only, such as with an absolute URL (http://www.your-site.com/example-page.html), or with a relative URL (your-directory/example-file.html). The old list tags could have represented a list of images, or types of something, regardless if it was a link or not.

The new section tag would be great for home pages where you might have links to different sections of your site and want to represent certain types of content in each section. The article tag is also a “no brainer”. Should have had this years ago. I really like the tag too! A better way to represent content that is somehow related to but not directly part of an article or a pages content.

Readability and W3C go both ways. HTML5 layout hierarchy gives greater weight to section tag, for layout reasons. Article tag locations are designer semantic, content delivery. CSS weighting, heavy-to-lightweight seems to run section-article-div. Making section a fantastic content anchor, article a reliable placeholder, and div an unobtrusive manipulator.

This is true, Dan. But in Chrome and IE (I only use later for now) the CSS cascade handles section and article differently, depending on parent-child relations.

article and section are newbies – p a and h1 have been around a while
screen layout reflects the stability of older (foundation?) elements

sometimes designers have to code like bug testers – push both incidences and you have more control
not sure if that applies with article and section – they’re on steroids for now

Hey Chathura,

Maybe someone already answered this for you, but according to Matt Cutts, who is a big wig @ Google and is pretty sociable with people who ask questions regarding best practices for SEO, he states that multiple H1’s on a single page is okay to use, but use with caution and moderation. Meaning use H1’s where they make sense! Typically when I develop a site I use an H1 for the logo (just on the home page) and the home page’s main title can also have an H1, because they are both separated pretty well in different sections of the site. When it comes to doing an interior layout page I removed the H1 from the logo and just go with a basic anchor instead which leaves only one H1 on the page and it is dedicated to the page title.

Hope this makes sense.

Maybe this has been addressed, but I see this on many websites now a days where the developers have totally skipped over the H1 tag and go straight to using H2’s for things such as the page title/article title of the page… I’m confused to this as H1 is supposed to be used for the pages main title… Is there any explanation as to why this is becoming a common theme among website now a days? Pretty confusing to me and I’m also going out on a limb and thinking the developers of whatever website that uses H2 as the main page title are just lazy and not noticing the type of html element being used.

It’s getting more common to have a banner or logo-image in place of the H1 headline. Sub-headlines would still feel like they should be H2s and so-on. There’s really no good reason to even use H-tags since we tend to reset all the default styles anyway and web page design are getting away from the print-model.

The unasked question is, should the logo be in an H1 tag.. maybe with a Rel attribute to go with it? Would anybody care?

I think the purpose of the Article tag is mainly for bloggy goodness. If your making a non-news/info page, having the Article tag is kinda misleading, though I suppose it might make a nice Paragraph wrapper. In the end though, it’s all symantics. You can do an entire page in nothing but Divs.

How is this any different than standard HTML?
Which are HTML5 specific elements!?

Permalink to comment# December 1, 2016
Dear All,

In HTML 5, the Specific flow or structural skeleton is well described above.
It basically has 7 core elements, unlike in html4 and earlier versions, we were depending on div tags towards these roles by using CSS to display in the required / necessary format.

In HTML 5
that basic purpose of div and controlling them with CSS is appended (Note: Just a standard addon not removed.), and thoroughly new ammendments were made with these core tags serving the purpose much more efficiently, they are as follows.

1) Header :

2) Nav :

3) Main:
4) Section:

5) Article:

6) Aside:

7) Footer:

Now professionally, you can use all of these or some of these as suggested by Chris or adopting a liberal approach where you can make a combination of both the above tags and div or else just go with the traditional usage of div and css.

The differnce and details about them is explained with simple example in the below comment.

Reply
Vashi
Permalink to comment# December 1, 2016
Now, Just as I stated above,

in a traditional approach

<

div id=”footer”>

where all the id values are precisely defined in CSS, and only act accordingly, here the purpose and role depends on the definition we make in CSS.

In Standard HTML 5

</header

  <article>
<

section>

(optional * not a cumpolsary tag to be used but definitely a good addon)

Here the CSS still plays a vital role, but only for visual styling rather than role assignment to the tags on the primary level.

Now the

<

header> tag is used to display the top section of the page where the logo, search bar, login, subscription, etc., other significant elements are placed.
Note: it is also placed inside the content for titles or just as highlighter etc.,

<

nav> tag, as usual meant to be used for our menu of the site.
Note: it can also be placed any where, need not be right after the header (depends on type of menu -vertical/horizontal/large/ multi purpose etc.,), or else can be used even for inner menus placed in sidebar (either horizontally or vertically.)

<

section> tag is a tag which holds, some content be it a menu on as sidebar or a place of new postings display, or image gallery etc.,
Note: it can be placed anywhere on the site, the core purpose is to hold some content.

<

article> tag is a tag which also hold the data, but only on a specific context, rather than multiple contexts
eg: assume if you are speaking about on “Prime minister” you can hold as many details only regarding that speicified subject, you can not suddenly say about “President” in the same context.
but if you are speaking about politics you can inlude both Prime minister and President, they both become part of the context.

Let me detail you with a swift example

POLITICS

Prime MInister
Name: John
Age: 45
Party: XYZ party
XYZ party is a national party established in1990

Biography

President
Name: John
Age: 45
Party: ABC Party
ABC party is a regional party established in 2001

Biography

</section
Now here Politics is treated as a section, and the articles included are Prime minister and President.
We can make use of this section again but then only the details of the prime minister
for eg:-
Name:,
Age:
Area of Contest:
Party he/she belongs to:
How many times he won:
Details / Biography:
etc., would be treated as sections with in the article.
Similarly for the other as well.
Meanwhile, there is an interesting element/tag

to be spoken. This also serves definite purposes, but sould allways be realted to the context though not actually part of it as you see in the above example it speaks about some specific part related to the context but not part of it.

tag is the content holder where the main portion of the site resides which may include any from slider to, menu, forms, details of the site etc.,

Last comes the

<

footer> tag
as its purpose and role need not be explained, presuming you all know what is it meant for.

I believe, the explanation is a bit lengthy, but definite to the point and understandable.
for any queries, you can comment back or reach me on my mail info.ontechs@gmail.com

I really appreciate “Chris” for this splendid and beautiful portal with such massive bundle of knowledge.

What is the difference between article and section?
• both can:
o be nested in each other
o take a different notion in a different context or nesting level

• sections are like book chapters
o they usually have siblings (maybe in a different document?)
o together they have something in common, like chapters in a book

• one author, one article, at least on the lowest level
o standard example: a single blog comment
o a blog entry itself is also a good example
o a blog entry article and its comment articles could also be wrapped with an article
o it’s some “complete” thing, not a part in a series of similar

• sections in an article are like chapters in a book
• articles in a section are like poems in a volume (within a series)

https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/sections.html#the-article-element

Note that the examples in the spec show section and article both nested within each other; there is no simple rule stating one should only/always be nested within another.

Maybe need adding the main content role, or main tag.

It’s totally acceptable to include articles inside of a section. The spec currently states:

The section element represents a generic section of a document or application. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content. Each section should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1-h6 element) as a child of the section element.

And, as far as articles go, they can and self-contained elements within a page:

The article element represents a complete, or self-contained, composition in a document, page, application, or site.

Taken together, the section can be a group of thematically-related articles that are self-contained elements. The only thing that might be updated here is including a title inside of the section.
